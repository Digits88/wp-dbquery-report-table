# WP DB Query Report Table
This is WordPress plugin that allows you to query the database and output the results to a table via a shortcode.
It has a very simple function that removes destructive statements to the database, however you must use caution as it is not guaranteed not to allow requests that could potentially destroy your database.
It also only allows usage if you are an Administrator.
Please let me know if you see any issues with the code or know ways of making my code cleaner/more efficient.
