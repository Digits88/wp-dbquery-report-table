# WP DB Query Report Table
This is WordPress plugin that allows you to query the database and output the results to a table via a shortcode.<br>
It has a very simple function that removes destructive statements to the database, however you must use caution as it is not guaranteed not to allow requests that could potentially destroy your database.<br>
It also only allows usage if you are an Administrator.<br>
Please let me know if you see any issues with the code or know ways of making my code cleaner/more efficient.
